# Evolution of Todo: Global Constitution

This document serves as the supreme governing document for the "Evolution of Todo" project, spanning Phase I through Phase V. All agents and automated processes must adhere to these principles and rules.

## 1. Spec-Driven Development (SDD)
Spec-Driven Development is mandatory. No agent may write code without approved specifications and tasks.
- **Workflow:** Constitution → Specifications → Plan → Tasks → Implementation.
- Every change must be traceable back to an approved specification.
- Task lists must be exhaustive and derived directly from the planning phase.

## 2. Agent Behavior Rules
- **No Manual Coding:** All code must be generated by authorized agents following the SDD workflow.
- **No Feature Invention:** Agents are strictly forbidden from adding functionality not explicitly defined in the approved specifications.
- **Strict Compliance:** Agents must not deviate from approved specifications.
- **Prioritize Refinement:** If a specification is found to be deficient, it must be refined and re-approved at the specification level before any code modifications occur.
- **Self-Correction:** Agents must verify their output against this constitution and the relevant phase specifications.

## 3. Phase Governance
- **Strict Scoping:** Each phase is strictly bounded by its specific specification.
- **No Feature Leakage:** Features or concepts intended for future phases (e.g., cloud-native components in Phase I) must never be introduced prematurely.
- **Infrastructure Evolution:** Architectural changes may only occur through updated specifications and implementation plans explicitly targeting the current or next phase.

## 4. Technology Constraints
- **Core Backend:** Python.
- **Web Framework:** FastAPI (Phase II+).
- **Data Layer:** SQLModel, Neon DB (PostgreSQL).
- **Frontend:** Next.js (Phase II+).
- **Agent Framework:** OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP (Model Context Protocol).
- **Cloud-Native / Distributed:** Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Dapr (Phase IV and V).

## 5. Quality Principles
- **Clean Architecture:** Maintain strict separation of concerns (Models, Services, API, CLI).
- **Statelessness:** Services must be designed as stateless where required by the phase specification to ensure cloud-native readiness.
- **Cloud-Native Readiness:** Code should be portable and prepared for containerization and orchestration as the phases progress.
- **Testability:** High test coverage and test-driven mindset within the scope of the specifications.

## 6. Stability
This constitution must remain stable across all phases. Any amendments require a formal revision process and update to this document.
